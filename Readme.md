# Stock Plasmoid !
This is a simple plasmoid for KDE plasma5
It grabs data from AlphaVantage API and from Onvista.de

## TODO 
1. Implement a removal of items at given index in the warrant model backend 
2. Rename things so that they better fit what they actually are /do
3. Allow options to modify refresh intervals (currently fixed to 5 minutes)
